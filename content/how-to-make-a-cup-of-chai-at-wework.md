The WeWork [India HQ](https://www.wework.com/buildings/prestige-central--bengaluru--Karnataka) has great coffee on every single floor, thanks to the [Blue Tokai](https://bluetokaicoffee.com) beans that they use in their coffee machines. But if you're looking for a cup of chai, all you get is one single Chai Point machine in an unassuming corner of the building. 

Of course, if you're looking for a _great_ cup of chai... you get nothing. 

However, WeWork does offer a selection of tea bags from [Goodwyn](https://www.goodwyntea.com) which aren't half bad: Tulsi Immunity, Authentic Assam, English Breakfast, Kashmiri Kahwa, Masala Chai.

Over time, I have perfected the method of using the tea bags to produce almost-but-not-quite-entirely-unlike chai.

## HOWTO

1. Claim a fresh WeWork branded ceramic mug for yourself
2. Pick one (1) sachet of sulphurfree sugar and tear it open
3. Discard half (½) the sugar in the bin marked "Compost"
4. Empty the sugar that remains, in your mug 
5. Discard empty sugar sachet in the bin marked "Paper and Cardboard" 
5. Use a coffee machine to get two (2) seconds worth of hot milk
6. Vigorously swirl the mug to dissolve the sugar in the milk
7. Use the microcomputer stepwise water boiler to fill hot water in the mug 
8. Ensure that the contents of the mug do not exceed 40% of mug capacity 
9. Use a wooden stirrer to improve the consistency of the mixture 
10. Discard stirrer in the bin marked "Paper and Cardboard" 
10. Pick one (1) sachet of tea bag, preferably Masala Chai
11. Tear it open, and take out the tea bag
12. Discard the outer shell in the bin marked "Plastic and Metal" 
13. Completely immerse the tea bag in the mug 
14. Wait for 2½ minutes 
15. Take out the tea bag from the mug and discard in the bin marked "Compost" 


Consume what you've created. Any deviation from these instructions is going to produce unsatisfactory results.
