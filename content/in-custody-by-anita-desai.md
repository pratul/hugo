I’ve been very fond of Anita Desai’s writing since I read Games At Twilight back in high school. That story had such a strong impact on me because I had no idea that one could take a topic as ordinary as the game of hide and seek, and transform it into an emotional experience of being a child itself. 

In Custody itself, was recommended [somewhere on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/), and the prominent emotion of the book is helplessness. The story starts out by Deven feeling trapped and helpless due to circumstances… and it never recovers! I don’t remember the last time I read a book that made me feel so sorry about a character, not because of what they experience, but because things never become better for them. I’m not sure how many people would like a story crafted in such a way. 

The writing is beautiful and soul-stirring. It isn’t always simple but it also does not feel needlessly complicated — over the years my patience for sitting through “fancy” words which express simple emotions, has disappeared. So I’d still call the book accessible. 

Great story, good read. Recommended.
