In this age, engineering hiring needs a marketing strategy[^1] 

everyone is fighting for the same talent

salaries are at an all time high 

write a compelling JD 

be a differentiator 

remove bullshit 

signal over noise 

craft a story 

everyone is cool, everyone is scale, everyone is impact, why are you different? 

being clear and honest can be an easy win.

Reply to candidates that matter. It’s a huge deal. So obviously… Filter out crap as soon as possible.
