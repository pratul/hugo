When [kitallis](https://kitallis.mataroa.blog/) introduced me to [mataroa](https://mataroa.blog), I did not expect it to do for me what it has done. 

As a writing platform, it takes nothing to get started. There are barely any options I can configure. All settings fit on just one page. I cannot add external analytics to my blog, not even something simple like Plausible. Basic server-driven analytics are all that I get. I cannot change the colors of the background or the pagination on the homepage. There are no cookies and no tracking of any kind. There is no built-in search. 

I cannot even fiddle with things I *definitely* do care about, like the typographic experience of the reader. But I’ve realized that because I have no control over any of it… I have stopped caring. Maybe not forever, but for now at least. That is downright *amazing* because I am now able to do the one thing I have always wanted to do with a blog. 

Write.

As someone who has to put in *effort* to focus on what I want to get done, this is a gift. The one metric that mattered has started improving: I published one post and I have *three* pending drafts that are very close to being done.

For every single thing that mataroa does not have, in comparison to “competing” services like Posthaven or Svbtle, it already has some things I consider critical for a personal blogging service:

I can use my own domain. ^_^ 

I can pay for the service, [as one should](https://mataroa.blog/modus/transparency/). The price (currently 9 USD per year) is so low that even if I write just a few times a year, it will cost less than the food I will consume while writing those posts. 

That price figure is also important in another way: most platforms charge 5-15 USD per *month* which IMHO is too high a price for a regular person’s tiny place on the internet. It puts undue pressure to write something, anything, every time that line item shows up in the credit card statement. 

Even if mataroa were to vanish overnight, my writing is with me: [every month I get an email](https://hey.mataroa.blog/blog/monthly-auto-exports-via-email/) with an archive of all posts exported as markdown. This is *great* product design — I wish I had thought of such a simple backup feature. 

Anyone can subscribe via email! Anyone can subscribe via RSS!

So glad you exist, mataroa. <3
