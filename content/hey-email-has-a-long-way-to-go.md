This tweet prompted me to publish this draft which has been brewing for more than a year. https://twitter.com/heyhey/status/1501986303574872082 — glad that the search feature has massively imrpove but there’s so much more to be done. 


Stuff is too slow forever 

Weird conversation thread behaviour. Doesn't show read/unread state for messages in a conversation.

Search is strange on desktop, hard to go back to list of results. 

When going back to list on mobile it does not remember the scroll or page position

Button presses do not have any feedback on mobile apps 


In Hey menu, button click area does not extend horizontally all the way 

Widgets show wrong information when on airplane mode. They go empty


Old emails cannot be viewed offline or if the network is poor. for ex boarding pass attachment.


Cannot edit an email address. Gotta type the whole thing out again like a loser.
