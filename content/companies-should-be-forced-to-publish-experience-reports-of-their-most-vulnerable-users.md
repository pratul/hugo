Maria is having a terrible experience with phonepe because no one is helping her. She has lost a significant sum of money. 

Ankur's mom struggling with UPI because BHIM was fucking up 

Aarika's relative losing money because scam 

I'm not saying UPI and the likes have not pushed things forward. They have and they've made a big difference. 

but at scale, especially in india, the average user isn't the one tweeting about your service or drinking coffee at blue tokai or hanging out at wework. far far from it. 

how does the average person experience progress? banks still suck. all the modern apps definitely suck. ola and uber suck like shit. because they look at the top 20-30% of the experience and shout out "yay we're the best" 

we need to see the bottom of the barrel, not the users who may be contributing a lot to your bottom line... but the ones getting impacted in the worst ways possible and have no recourse.

kinda the same as how we look at CFR and MTTR for services right? we care about positive metrics but where are the negative metrics? who will measure them? who will tackle them? 

Simple did this very well but it was an outlier team of outlier thinkers and executors.
