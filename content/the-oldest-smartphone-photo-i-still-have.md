I am confident I clicked hundreds of other photos before this one, on one of the various Nokias I used through 2006-2010. But the photos were too poor in quality, not worth saving, and Google Photos with near-infinite storage was yet to be created.

I took this photo on 10th December 2010 using a [Samsung Galaxy Apollo i5801](https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_i5801_galaxy_apollo-3432.php) phone. What’s in the photo? It’s a display connected to some random rack server at the [IITK campus](https://cse.iitk.ac.in) running some random (Fedora? Arch?) Linux distribution. I think the network card conked out on it, because I seem to be trying to locate the name of the Ethernet controller.

Writing this post made me fondly remember all the smartphones I have ever owned, excluding the hand-me-downs. Starting from the newest, they are iPhone 12, Pixel 3, Pixel 1 XL, Moto X, Nexus 5X, Galaxy Nexus, and HTC Desire. 

What a trip.
