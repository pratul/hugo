A while ago, I found [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/light-themes/+bug/532633/comments/564](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/light-themes/+bug/532633/comments/564). That’s right, the Ubuntu SABDFL has confirmed that the new OS X style window title bar button placement, is here to stay. 

In response, the following theory was proposed by nirbheek on #hackers-india

< nirbheek> Step 1: Make incredibly lame decision which is utterly stupid, without reason, and actually backwards  
< nirbheek> Step 2: Refuse to listen to people when they tell you so   
< nirbheek> Step 3: Retract parts of the lame decision so that what you actually wanted from the start is done, i.e. mac-style button-placement   
< nirbheek> Step 4: Everyone goes “Oh thank god”   

Canonical, we know what you’re doing.
